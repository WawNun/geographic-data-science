## Introduction

Points are spatial entities that can be understood in two fundamentally different ways. On the one hand, points can be seen as fixed objects in space, which is to say their location is taken as given (*exogenous*). In this interpretation, the location of an observed point is considered as secondary to the value observed at the point. Think of this like measuring the number of cars traversing a given road intersection; the location is fixed, and the data of interest comes from the measurement taken at that location. The analysis of this kind of point data is very similar to that of other types of spatial data such as polygons and lines. On the other hand, an observation occuring at a point can also be thought of as a site of measurement from an underlying geographically-continuous process. In this case, the measurement could theoretically take place anywhere, but was only carried out or conducted in certain locations. Think of this as measuring the length of birds' wings: the location at which birds are measured reflects the underlying geographical process of bird movement and foraging, and the length of the birds' wings may reflect an underlying ecological process that varies by bird. This kind of approach means that both the location and the measurement matter. This is the perspective we will adopt in the rest of the chapter.

When points are seen as events that could take place in several locations but only happen in a few of them, a collection of such events is called a *point pattern*. In this case, the location of points is one of the key aspects of interest for analysis. A good example of a point pattern is crime events in a city: they could technically happen in many locations but we usually find crimes are committed only in a handful of them. Point patterns can be *marked*, if more attributes are provided with the location, or *unmarked*, if only the coordinates of where the event occured are provided. Continuing the crime example, an unmarked pattern would result if only the location where crimes were committed was used for analysis, while we would be speaking of a marked point pattern if other attributes, such as the type of crime, the extent of the damage, etc. was provided with the location.

Point pattern analysis is thus concerned with the visualization, description, statistical characerization, and modeling of point patterns, focusing specially on the generating process that gives rise and explains the observed data. Common questions in this domain include
- *What does the pattern look like?* 
- *What is the nature of the distribution of points?* 
- *Is there any structure in the way locations are arranged over space? That is, are events clustered? or are they dispersed?*
- *Why do events occur in those places and not in others?* 
These are the most common questions in the analysis of point patterns. 

At this point, it is useful to remind ourselves of an important distinction, that between process and pattern. The former relates to the underlying mechanism that is at work to generate the outcome we end up observing. Because of its abstract nature, we do not get to see it. However, in many contexts, the key focus of any analysis is to learn about *what* determines a given phenomenon and *how* those factors combine to generate it. In this context, "process" is associated with the *how*. "Pattern," on the other hand, relates to the result of that process. In some cases, it is the only trace of the process we can observe and thus the only input we have to work with in order to reconstruct it. Although directly observable and, arguably, easier to tackle, pattern is only a reflection of process. The real challenge in many applications is not to characterize the former but to use it to work out the latter.

In this chapter, we will focus on an introduction to point patters through geo-tagged Flickr photos from Tokyo. In this case, we will treat the phenomena represented in the data as events: photos could be taken of any place in Tokyo, but only certain locations are captured. Keep in mind this understanding of Tokyo photos is not immutable: one could conceive cases where it makes sense to take those locations as given and look at the properties of each of them ignoring their "event" aspect. However, in this context, we will focus on those questions that relate to location and the collective shape of locations. The use of these tools will allow us to transform a long list of unintelligible XY coordinates into tangible phenomena with a characteristic spatial structure, and to answer questions about the center, dispersion, and clustering of attractions in Tokyo for Flickr users.

## Location, Location, Location

The rise of new forms of data such as geotagged photos uploaded to online services is creating new ways for researchers to study and understand cities. Where to people take pictures? When are those pictures taken? Why certain places attract many more photographers than others? All these questions and more become more than just rethorical ones when we consider volunteered geographic information (VGI, {cite}`Goodchild2007citizens`) in the form of online photo hosting services. In this vignette we will explore metadata from a sample of georeferenced images uploaded to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) and extracted thanks to the [100m Flickr dataset](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=i&did=67). To do that, we will introduce a few approaches that help us better understand the distribution and characteristics of a point pattern. To get started, let's load the flickr data first:


```python
db = pandas.read_csv('../data/tokyo/tokyo_clean.csv')
```

This table has been lightly processed from the raw data. It contains the user ID, the latitude and longitude, as well as those coordinates expressed in Pseudo Mercator, the timestamp when the photo was taken, and the url of the picture they refer to:


```python
db.head()
```

## Visualization

The first step to get a sense of what the spatial dimension of this dataset looks like is to plot it. At its most basic level, we can generate a scatter plot with a single line:


```python
# Generate scatter plot
seaborn.jointplot(x='longitude', y='latitude', data=db, s=0.5);
```


This is a good start: we can see dots tend to be concentrated in the center of the covered area in a very (apparently) not random. Furthermore, within the broad pattern, we can also see there seems to be more localised clusters. However, the plot above has two key drawbacks: one, it lacks geographical context; and two, there are areas where the density of points is so large that it is hard to tell anything beyond a blue blurb. 

Start with the context. The easiest way to provide additional context is by ovelaying a tile map from the internet. Let us quickly call `contextily` for that. We first obtain the bounding box of the point pattern.


```python
# Extract bounding box from the `x` and `y` columns
bounding_box = [db.x.min(), db.y.min(), db.x.max(), db.y.max()]
```

Then, we can pull the tiles down using `contextily.bounds2img`:


```python
# Download map tiles
basemap, basemap_extent = contextily.bounds2img(*bounding_box, zoom=11,
                                                url = contextily.providers.CartoDB.Positron)
```

    <ipython-input-6-8a25bf4e1df7>:2: FutureWarning: The "url" option is deprecated. Please use the "source" argument instead.
      basemap, basemap_extent = contextily.bounds2img(*bounding_box, zoom=11,


Now, `basemap` is an array containing the raw image data for a basemap of Tokyo, and the `extent` is the boundary of that image, in terms of the same pseudo-Mercator projection the data uses. However, it is important to note that many of the mapping tools in spatial analysis express their bounding box in **corner form**:
```
left, bottom, right, top
```
This is **corner form** because it stitches together the locations of the bottom-left and top-right of the map. Despite the geographic analysis tools' focus on corner-form bounds, many of the *plotting* tools in Python express their bounding box in an **edge form**, stitching together the left & right edges with the bottom & top edges:
```
left, right, bottom, top
```
This can be confusing. We will be consistent in referring to a **corner form** boundary as a `bounding_box`, whereas an `extent` will refer to an **edge form** boundary. 

You can see this practically by comparing our original `bounding_box` to the `basemap_extent` returned from `contextily`. Since the `basemap_extent` is used in plotting, it is in edge form. But, since `contextily` takes its input from geographical data, it expects a `bounding_box` in corner form, as input. 


```python
bounding_box
```

```python
basemap_extent
```




    (15517328.23811706, 15576031.875840075, 4226661.916057105, 4285365.553780119)



For convenience, sometime is it also helpful to define the `data_extent` as well, in case the basemap covers too much additional area:


```python
data_extent = [db.x.min(), db.x.max(), db.y.min(), db.y.max()]
```

### Dots on a map

Together, adding a basemap to our initial plot really makes the pattern of Flickr data clearer:


```python
# Set up figure and axis
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(9, 9))
# Add map tiles for context
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, 
          interpolation='bilinear')
# Plot photograph points
ax.scatter(db['x'], db['y'], s=0.75)
ax.axis(data_extent)
# Display
plt.show()
```


### Hex-binning

Let us now take care of the second problem. When some areas of town have too many dots, plotting opaque dots on top of one another can make it hard to tell any pattern or see through to explore the characteristics of the area. For example, in the middle of the map, towards the right, there is the highest concentration of pictures taken; this sheer amount of dots on the maps in some parts obscures whether all of that area receives as many pics or whether, within there, some places receive a particularly high degree of attention.

The first solution for this, which has become very popular in the last few years, is a *spatial* or *2-dimensional histogram*. Here, we generate a regular grid (either squared or hexagonal), count how many dots fall within each grid cell, and present it as we would any other choropleth. This is attractive because it is simple, intuitive, and the regular grid removes some of the area distortions choropleths may induce. We will use hexagonal binning (sometimes called hexbin) because it has slightly nicer properties than squared grids, such as larger flexibility in the shape and better connectivity between cells. Creating a hexbin 2-d histogram is straightforward in Python using the `hexbin` function:


```python
# Set up figure and axis
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(9, 9))
# Add map tiles for context
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, interpolation='bilinear')
# Generate and add hexbin with 50 hexagons in each 
# dimension, no borderlines, half transparency,
# and the reverse viridis colormap
hb = ax.hexbin(db['x'], db['y'],
               gridsize=50, linewidths=0,
               alpha=0.5, cmap='viridis_r')
ax.axis(data_extent)
# Add colorbar
plt.colorbar(hb)
# Remove axes
ax.set_axis_off()
```


Voila, this allows a lot more detail! It is now clear that the majority of photographs relate to much more localised areas and that the previous map was obscuring this.

### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

Grids are the spatial equivalent of a histogram: the user decides how many "buckets", and the points are counted within them in a discrete fashion. This is fast, efficient, and potentially very detailed (if many bins are created). However, it does represent a discretisation of an essentially contiguous phenomenon and, as such, it may introduce distortions (e.g. MAUP). An alternative approach is to instead create what is known as a kernel density estimation (KDE): an empirical approximation of the probability density function. This approach is covered in detail elsewhere (e.g. {cite}`Silverman1986density`), but we can provide the intuition here. Instead of overlaying a grid of squares of hexagons and count how many points fall within each, a KDE lays a grid of points over the space of interest on which it places kernel functions that count points around them with different weight based on the distance. These counts are then aggregated to generate a global surface with probability. The most common kernel function is the gaussian one, which applies a normal distribution to weight points. The result is a continuous surface with a probability function that may be evaluated at every point. Creating a gaussian kernel in Python is rather straightfoward:


```python
# Set up figure and axis
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(9, 9))
# Add map tiles for context
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, interpolation='bilinear')
# Generate and add KDE with a shading of 50 gradients 
# coloured contours, 75% of transparency,
# and the reverse viridis colormap
seaborn.kdeplot(db['x'], db['y'],
                n_levels=50, shade=True,
                alpha=0.55, cmap='viridis_r')
# Remove axes
ax.axis(data_extent)
ax.set_axis_off()
```


The result is a much smoother output that captures the same structure of the hexbin but eases the transitions between different areas. This provides a better generalisation of the theoretical probability that a picture *might* occur at any given point. This is useful in some cases, but is mainly of use to escape the restrictions imposed by a regular grid of hexagons or squares. 

## Centrography

Centrography is the analysis of centrality in a point pattern. By "centrality," we mean the general location and dispersion of the pattern. Many different measures are used in centrography to provide an indication of "where" a point pattern is, how tightly the point pattern clusters around its center, or how irregular its shape is. 

For instance, one common measure of central tendency for a point pattern is its *center of mass*. For marked point patterns, the center of mass identifies a central point close to observations that have higher values in their marked attribute. For unmarked point patterns, the center of mass is equivalent to the *mean center*, or average of the coordinate values. In addition, the *median center* is analogous to the *median* elsewhere, and represents a point where half of the data is above or below the point & half is to its left or right. We can analyze the mean center with our flickr point pattern using the `pointpats` package in Python. 


```python
from pointpats import centrography
```


```python
mean_center = centrography.mean_center(db[['x', 'y']])
med_center = centrography.euclidean_median(db[['x', 'y']])
```

It is easiest to visualize this by plotting the point pattern and its mean center alongside one another:


```python
# Set up figure and axis
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(9, 9))
# Add map tiles for context
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, 
          interpolation='bilinear')
# Plot photograph points
ax.scatter(db['x'], db['y'], s=0.75)
ax.scatter(*mean_center, color='red', marker='x', label='Mean Center')
ax.scatter(*med_center, color='limegreen', marker='o', label='Median Center')
ax.axis(data_extent)
ax.legend()
# Display
plt.show()
```


The discrepancy between the two centers is caused by the skew; there are many "clusters" of pictures far out in West& South Tokyo, whereas North & East Tokyo is densely packed, but drops off very quickly. Thus, the far out clusters of pictures pulls the mean center to the west and south, relative to the median center. 

A measure of dispersion that is common in centrography is the *standard distance*. This measure provides the average distance away from the center of the point cloud (such as measured by the center of mass). This is also simple to compute using `pointpats`, using the `std_distance` function:


```python
centrography.std_distance(db[['x','y']])
```
This means that, on average, pictures are taken around 8800 feet away from the mean center. 

Another helpful visualization is the *standard deviational ellipse*, or *standard ellipse*. This is an ellipse drawn from the data that reflects both its center and dispersion. To visualize this, we first compute the axes and rotation using the `ellipse` function in `pointpats`:


```python
major, minor, rotation = centrography.ellipse(db[['x','y']])
```


```python
from matplotlib.patches import Ellipse
```


```python
# Set up figure and axis
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(9, 9))
# Add map tiles for context
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, 
          interpolation='bilinear')
# Plot photograph points
ax.scatter(db['x'], db['y'], s=0.75)
ax.scatter(*mean_center, color='red', marker='x', label='Mean Center')
ax.scatter(*med_center, color='limegreen', marker='o', label='Median Center')

# Construct the standard ellipse using matplotlib
ellipse = Ellipse(xy=mean_center, # center the ellipse on our mean center
                  width=major*2, # centrography.ellipse only gives half the axis
                  height=minor*2, 
                  angle = numpy.rad2deg(rotation), # Angles for this are in degrees, not radians
                  facecolor='none', 
                  edgecolor='red', linestyle='--',
                  label='Std. Ellipse')
ax.add_patch(ellipse)

ax.axis(data_extent)
ax.legend()
# Display
plt.show()
```


Finally, another collection of measures about point patterns characterize the extent of a point cloud. Four shapes are useful, and reflect varying levels of how "tightly" they bind the pattern. 

Below, we'll walk through how to construct each example and visualize them at the end. To make things more clear, we'll use the flickr photos for the most prolific user in the dataset to show how different these results can be.


```python
user = db.query('user_id == "95795770@N00"')
coordinates = user[['x','y']].values
```

First, we'll compute the **convex hull**, which is the tighest *convex* shape that encloses the user's photos. By *convex*, we mean that the shape never "doubles back" on itself; it has no divets, valleys, crenelations, or holes. All of its interior angles are smaller than 180 degrees.  This is computed using the `centrography.hull` method.


```python
convex_hull_vertices = centrography.hull(coordinates)
```

Second, we'll compute the **alpha shape**, which is like a "tighter" version of the convex hull. One way to think of a convex hull is that it's the space left over when rolling a **really** large ball or circle all the way around the shape. The ball is so large relative to the shape, its radius is actually infinite, and the lines forming the convex hull are actually just straight lines! 

In contrast, you can think of an alpha shape as the space made from rolling a *small* balls around the shape. Since the ball is smaller, it rolls into the dips & valleys created between points. As that ball gets bigger, the alpha shape becomes the convex hull. But, for small balls, the shape can get very tight indeed. In fact, if alpha gets too small, it "slips" through the points, resulting in *more than one hull!* As such, the `pysal` package has an `alpha_shape_auto` function to find the smallest *single* alpha shape, so that you don't have to guess at how big the ball needs to be. 


```python
# TODO: Change this to use July 2020 release of PySAL with this function in libpysal
import libpysal
alpha_shape, alpha, circs = libpysal.cg.alpha_shape_auto(coordinates, return_circles=True)
```

To illustrate, the figure below has the tightest single alpha shape shown in green and the original source points shown in black. The "bounding" circles shown in the figure all have a radius of $8652$ meters. The circles are plotted where our "bounding" disk touches two or three of the points in the point cloud. You can see that the circles "cut into" the convex hull, shown in blue dashed lines, up until they touch two (or three) points. Any tighter, and the circle would disconnect one of the points on the boundary of the alpha shape. 


```python
from descartes import PolygonPatch #to plot the alpha shape easily
f,ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(9,9))

# Plot a green alpha shape
ax.add_patch(PolygonPatch(alpha_shape, edgecolor='green', 
                          facecolor='green', alpha=.2, label = 'Tighest alpha shape'))

# Include the points for our prolific user in black
ax.scatter(*coordinates.T, color='k', marker='.', label='Source Points')
# Add a basemap
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent)

# plot the circles forming the boundary of the alpha shape
for i, circle in enumerate(circs):
    # only label the first circle of its kind
    if i == 0:
        label = 'Bounding Circles'
    else:
        label = None
    ax.add_patch(plt.Circle(circle, radius=alpha, facecolor='none', edgecolor='r', label=label))
    

# add a blue convex hull
ax.add_patch(plt.Polygon(convex_hull_vertices, 
                            closed=True, 
                            edgecolor='blue', facecolor='none', 
                            linestyle=':', linewidth=2,
                            label='Convex Hull'))


plt.legend()

```
The remaining three bounding shapes are all rectangles or circles. First, we'll consider two kinds of **minimum bounding rectangles**. They both are constructed as the tightest *rectangle* that can be drawn around the data that contains all of the points. One kind of minimum bounding rectangle can be drawn just by considering vertical and horizontal lines. However, diagonal lines can often be drawn to construct a rectangle with a smaller area. This means that the **minimum rotated rectangle** provides a tighter rectangular bound on the point pattern, but the rectangle is askew or rotated. 

For the minimum rotated rectangle, we will use the `minimum_rotated_rectangle` function from the `pointpats.centrography` module. 


```python
min_rot_rect = centrography.minimum_rotated_rectangle(coordinates)
```

And, for the minimum bounding rectangle without rotation, we will use the `minimum_bounding_rectangle` function from the `pointpats` package.


```python
min_rect_vertices = centrography.minimum_bounding_rectangle(coordinates)
```

Finally, the **minimum bounding circle** is the smallest circle that can be drawn to enclose the entire dataset. Often, this circle is bigger than the minimum bounding rectangle. It is implemented in the `minimum_bounding_circle` function in `pointpats`. 


```python
(center_x, center_y), radius = centrography.minimum_bounding_circle(coordinates)
```

Now, to visualize these, we'll convert the raw vertices into matplotlib patches: 


```python
from matplotlib.patches import Polygon, Circle, Rectangle
from descartes import PolygonPatch

# Make a purple alpha shape
alpha_shape_patch = PolygonPatch(alpha_shape, 
                                 edgecolor='purple', facecolor='none', 
                                 linewidth=2,
                                 label='Alpha Shape')

# a blue convex hull
convex_hull_patch = Polygon(convex_hull_vertices, 
                            closed=True, 
                            edgecolor='blue', facecolor='none', 
                            linestyle=':', linewidth=2,
                            label='Convex Hull')

# a green minimum rotated rectangle
min_rot_rect_patch = Polygon(min_rot_rect, 
                             closed=True, 
                             edgecolor='green', facecolor='none', 
                             linestyle='--', 
                             label='Min Rotated Rectangle', linewidth=2)

# compute the width and height of the 
min_rect_width = min_rect_vertices[2] - min_rect_vertices[0]
min_rect_height = min_rect_vertices[2] - min_rect_vertices[0]

# a goldenrod minimum bounding rectangle
min_rect_patch = Rectangle(min_rect_vertices[0:2], 
                           width = min_rect_width,
                           height = min_rect_height,
                           edgecolor='goldenrod', facecolor='none', 
                           linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2, 
                           label='Min Bounding Rectangle', )

# and a red minimum bounding circle
circ_patch = Circle((center_x, center_y), radius=radius,
                    edgecolor='red', facecolor='none', linewidth=2,
                    label='Min Bounding Circle')
```

Finally, we'll plot the patches together with the photograph locations below:


```python
f,ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(10,10))
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, interpolation='bilinear')

ax.add_patch(alpha_shape_patch)
ax.add_patch(convex_hull_patch)
ax.add_patch(min_rot_rect_patch)
ax.add_patch(min_rect_patch)
ax.add_patch(circ_patch)

ax.scatter(db.x, db.y, s=.75, color='grey')
ax.scatter(user.x, user.y, s=100, color='r', marker='x')
ax.legend(ncol=1, loc='center left')
plt.show()
```


Each gives a different impression of the area enclosing the user's range of photographs. In this, you can see that the the alpha shape is much tighter than the rest of the shapes. The minimum bounding rectangle & circle are the "loosest" shapes, in that they contain the most area outside of the user's typical area. But, they're also the simplest shapes to draw and understand. 

## Randomness & clustering

Beyond questions of centrality and extent, spatial statistics on point patterns are often concerned with how *even* a distribution of points is. By this, we might want to inquire about whether points tend to all cluster near one another or whether they disperse evenly throughout the problem area. Questions like this refer to the *intensity* or *dispersion* of the point pattern overall. 

Many methods in spatial statistics are interested in this kind of clustering. We will cover a few of the methods useful for identifying clustering in locations of points across the flickr photographs in Tokyo. The first set of techniques, **quadrat** statistics, splits the data up into small areas and then examines the uniformity of counts across areas. The second set of techniques all derive from Ripley (1988), and involve measurements of the distance between points in a point pattern. 


```python
from pointpats import distance_statistics, QStatistic, random, PointPattern
```

For the purposes of illustration, it also helps to provide a pattern derived from a known *completely spatially random* process. That is, the location and number of points is totally random; there is neither clustering nor dispersion. In point pattern analysis, this is known as a *poisson point process*. 

To simulate these processes from a given point set, you can use the `pointpats.random` module. 


```python
random_pattern = random.poisson(coordinates, size=len(coordinates))
```


```python
f,ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(10,10))
plt.scatter(*coordinates.T, color='k', marker='.', label='Observed')
plt.scatter(*random_pattern.T, color='r', marker='x', label='Random')
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, interpolation='bilinear')
ax.legend(ncol=1, loc='center left')
plt.show()
```


As you can see, the simulation (by default) works with the bounding box of the input point pattern. To simulate from more restricted areas formed by the point pattern, pass those hulls to the simulator. 


```python
random_pattern_ashape = random.poisson(alpha_shape, size=len(coordinates))
```


```python
f,ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(10,10))
plt.scatter(*coordinates.T, color='k', marker='.', label='Observed')
plt.scatter(*random_pattern_ashape.T, color='r', marker='x', label='Random')
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, interpolation='bilinear')
ax.legend(ncol=1, loc='center left')
plt.show()
```

### Quadrat statistics

Quadrat statistics examine the spatial distribution of points in an area in terms of the count of observations that fall within a given cell. By examining whether observations are spread *evenly* over cells, the quadrat approach aims to estimate whether points are spread out, or if they are clustered into a few cells. Strictly speaking, quadrat statistics examine the *evenness* of the distribution over cells using a $\chi^2$ statistical test common in the analysis of contingency tables. 

In the `pointpats` package, you can visualize the results using the following `QStatistic.plot()` method. This shows the grid used to count the events, as well as the underlying pattern:


```python
qstat = QStatistic(coordinates)
qstat.plot()
```


In this case, for the default of a three by three grid spanning the point pattern, we see that the central square has over 350 observations, but the surrounding cells have many fewer flickr photographs. This means that the chi-squared test (which compares how likely this distribution is if the cell counts are uniform) will be statistically significant, with a very small p-value:


```python
qstat.chi2_pvalue
```
In contrast, our totally random point process will have nearly the same points in every cell:


```python
qstat_null = QStatistic(random_pattern)
qstat_null.plot()
```


This means its p-value will be large, and likely not significant:


```python
qstat_null.chi2_pvalue
```
Be careful, however: the fact that quadrat counts are measured in *regular tiling* within the study area (that is, squares or hexagons that cover the entire bounding box), irregular *but random* patterns can be mistakenly found "significant" by this approach. 

For example, on the random simulations from within the alpha shape, we have the following quadrat count:


```python
qstat_null_ashape = QStatistic(random_pattern_ashape)
qstat_null_ashape.plot()
```


The quadrat test finds this to be *statistically nonrandom*, while our simulating process ensured that *within the given study area*, the pattern is a complete spatially-random process. Thus, quadrat counts can have issues with irregular study areas, and care should be taken to ensure that clustering is not mistakenly identified. 


```python
qstat_null_ashape.chi2_pvalue
```

### Ripley's alphabet functions

A large branch of spatial statistics focuses on the distributions of three quantities in a point pattern. They derive from earlier work by {cite}`Ripley1991` on how to characterize clustering or co-location in point patterns. These each characterize some aspect of the point pattern as the distance from points increases. 

The first function, Ripley's $G$ function, focuses on the distribution of nearest neighbor distances. That is, the $G$ function summarises the distances between each point in the point pattern to their nearest neighbor in the pattern. 

In the plot below, this nearest neighbor logic is visualized with the red dots being a detailed view of the point pattern and the black arrows indicating the nearest neighbor to each point. Note that sometimes two points are *mutual* nearest neighbors (and so have arrows going in both directions) but some are not. 


```python
# this code should be hidden in the book, and only the plot visible!
f,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,4), sharex=True, sharey=True)
ax[0].scatter(*random_pattern.T, color='red')
ax[1].scatter(*random_pattern.T, color='red',
              zorder=100, marker='.', label='Points')
nn_ixs, nn_ds = PointPattern(random_pattern).knn(1)
first = True
for coord, nn_ix, nn_d in zip(random_pattern, nn_ixs, nn_ds):
    dx, dy = random_pattern[nn_ix].squeeze() - coord
    arrow = ax[1].arrow(*coord, dx,dy, 
                length_includes_head=True, 
                overhang=0, head_length=300*3,
                head_width=300*3, width=50*3,
                linewidth=0, facecolor='k',
                head_starts_at_zero=False)
    if first:
        plt.plot((1e100, 1e101), (0,1), color='k', 
                 marker='<', markersize=10,
                 label='Nearest Neighbor to Point')
    first = False

ax[0].axis([1.554e7, 1.556e7, 4240000, 4260000])
ax[0].set_xticklabels([])
ax[0].set_yticklabels([])
ax[0].set_xticks([])
ax[0].set_yticks([])
f.tight_layout()
ax[1].legend(bbox_to_anchor = (.5,-.06), fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```


Then, the distribution of these distances has a distinctive pattern under completely spatially random processes. We can compute the distribution of nearest neighbor distances of the observed pattern and compare it to the distribution for a set of simulated patterns that have been simulated according to a known spatially-random process, such as a spatial Poisson point process. 

To do this in the `pointpats` package, we can use the `g_test` function, which computes both the `G` function for the empirical data *and* these hypothetical replications under a completely spatially random process.


```python
g_test = distance_statistics.g_test(coordinates, support=40, keep_simulations=True)
```

Thinking about these distributions of distances, a "clustered" pattern must have more points near one another than a pattern that is "dispersed", and a completely random pattern should have something in between. Therefore, if the $G$ function increases *rapidly* with distance, we probably have a clustered pattern. If it increases *slowly* with distance, we have a dispersed pattern. Something in the middle will be difficult to distinguish from pure chance.

We can visualize this below. On the left, we plot the $G(d)$ function, with distance-to-point ($d$) on the horizontal axis and the fraction of nearest neighbor distances smaller than $d$ on the right axis. In red, the empirical cumulative distribution of nearest neighbor distances is shown. In blue, simulations (like the `random` pattern shown in the previous section) are shown. The bright blue line represents the average of all simulations, and the darker blue band around it represents the middle 95% of simulations. 

In this plot, we see that the red empirical function rises much faster than simulated completely spatially random patterns. This means that the observed pattern of this user's flickr photographs are *closer* to their nearest neighbors than would be expected from a completely spatially random pattern. The pattern is *clustered.*


```python
f,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(9,3), 
                    gridspec_kw=dict(width_ratios=(6,3)))
# plot all the simulations with very fine lines
ax[0].plot(g_test.support, g_test.simulations.T, color='k', alpha=.01)
# and show the average of simulations
ax[0].plot(g_test.support, numpy.median(g_test.simulations, axis=0), color='cyan', 
         label='median simulation')


# and the observed pattern's G function
ax[0].plot(g_test.support, g_test.statistic, label = 'observed', color='red')

# clean up labels and axes
ax[0].set_xlabel('distance')
ax[0].set_ylabel('% of nearest neighbor\ndistances shorter')
ax[0].legend()
ax[0].set_xlim(0,2000)
ax[0].set_title(r"Ripley's $G(d)$ function")

# plot the pattern itself on the next frame
ax[1].scatter(*coordinates.T)

# and clean up labels and axes there, too
ax[1].set_xticks([])
ax[1].set_yticks([])
ax[1].set_xticklabels([])
ax[1].set_yticklabels([])
ax[1].set_title('Pattern')
f.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


Another way to measure dispersion is to examine the *gaps* in the pattern. That is, where the $G$ function works by analyzing the distance *between* points in the pattern, the *F* function works by analyzing the distance *to* points in the pattern from locations in empty space. That is why the $F$ function is called the "the empty space function," since it characterizes the typical distance from arbitrary points in empty space to the point pattern. If the pattern has large gaps or empty areas, the $F$ function will increase slowly. But, if the pattern is highly dispersed, then the $F$ function will increase rapidly. 

We can use similar tooling to investigate the $F$ function, since it is so mathematically similar to the $G$ function. This is implemented identically using the `Fenv` function in `pointpats`. Since the $F$ function estimated for the observed pattern increases *much* more slowly than the $F$ functions for the simulated patterns, we can be confident that there are many gaps in our pattern; i.e. the pattern is *clustered*. 


```python
f_test = distance_statistics.f_test(coordinates, support=40, keep_simulations=True)
```


```python
f,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(9,3), 
                    gridspec_kw=dict(width_ratios=(6,3)))

# plot all the simulations with very fine lines
ax[0].plot(f_test.support, f_test.simulations.T, color='k', alpha=.01)
# and show the average of simulations
ax[0].plot(f_test.support, numpy.median(f_test.simulations, axis=0), color='cyan', 
         label='median simulation')


# and the observed pattern's F function
ax[0].plot(f_test.support, f_test.statistic, label = 'observed', color='red')

# clean up labels and axes
ax[0].set_xlabel('distance')
ax[0].set_ylabel('% of nearest point in pattern\ndistances shorter')
ax[0].legend()
ax[0].set_xlim(0,2000)
ax[0].set_title(r"Ripley's $F(d)$ function")

# plot the pattern itself on the next frame
ax[1].scatter(*coordinates.T)

# and clean up labels and axes there, too
ax[1].set_xticks([])
ax[1].set_yticks([])
ax[1].set_xticklabels([])
ax[1].set_yticklabels([])
ax[1].set_title('Pattern')
f.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

There are a few other functions that can be used for conducting point pattern analysis in this vein. Consult the `pointpats` documentation for more information on how this can be done in Python, or the book by {cite}`Baddeley2015`.

## Identifying clusters

The previous two sections on exploratory spatial analysis of point patterns provides methods to characterize whether point patterns are dispersed or clustered in space. However, knowing that a point pattern *is* clustered does not necessarily give us information about *where* that cluster resides. To do this, we must learn a method to identify clusters of points, based on their density across space. 

There are many spatial point clustering algorithms. Here, will cover the widely used `DBSCAN` algorithm. For this method, a cluster is a concentration of at least `m` points, each of them within a distance of `r` of at least another point in the cluster. Points in the dataset are then divided into three categories:

* *Noise*, for those points outside a cluster.
* *Cores*, for those points inside a cluster whith at least `m` points in the cluster within distance `r`.
* *Borders* for points inside a cluster with less than `m` other points in the cluster within distance `r`.

Both `m` and `r` need to be prespecified by the user before running `DBSCAN`. This is a critical point, as their value can influence significantly the final result. Before exploring this in greater depth, let us get a first run at computing `DBSCAN` in Python.


```python
# Compute DBSCAN
cs, lbls = dbscan(db[['x', 'y']])
```

The function returns two objects, which we call `cs` and `lbls`. `cs` contains the indices (order, starting from zero) of each point which is classified as a *core*. We can have a peek into it to see what it looks like:


```python
# Print the first 5 elements of `cs`
cs[:5]
```
The printout above tells us that the second (remember, Python starts counting at zero!) point in the dataset is a core, as it is the 23rd, 31st, 36th, and 43rd. The object `cs` always has a variable length, depending on how many cores the algorithm finds.

Now let us have a look at `lbls`, short for labels:


```python
lbls[:5]
```
The labels object always has the same length as the number of points used to run `DBSCAN`. Each value represents the index of the cluster a point belongs to. If the point is classified as *noise*, it receives a -1. Above, we can see that the second point belongs to cluster 1, while the others in the list are effectively not part of any cluster. To make thinks easier later on, let us turn `lbls` into a `Series` object that we can index in the same way as our collection of points:


```python
lbls = pandas.Series(lbls, index=db.index)
```

Now we already have the clusters, we can proceed to visualize them. There are many ways in which this can be done. We will start just by coloring points in a cluster in red and noise in grey:


```python
# Setup figure and axis
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(9, 9))
# Add base layer with tiles for context
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent)
# Subset points that are not part of any cluster (noise)
noise = db.loc[lbls==-1, ['x', 'y']]
# Plot noise in grey
ax.scatter(noise['x'], noise['y'], c='grey', s=5, linewidth=0)
# Plot all points that are not noise in red
# NOTE how this is done through some fancy indexing, where
#      we take the index of all points (tw) and substract from
#      it the index of those that are noise
ax.scatter(db.loc[db.index.difference(noise.index), 'x'], \
           db.loc[db.index.difference(noise.index), 'y'], \
          c='red', linewidth=0)
# Remove axes
ax.set_axis_off()
# Display the figure
plt.show()
```


Although informative, the result of this run is not particularly satisfactory. There are *way* too many points that are classified as "noise".

This is because we have run `DBSCAN` with the default parameters. If you type `dbscan?`, you will get the help of the function and will be able to see what those are: a radious of 0.5 and a minimum of five points per cluster. Since our data is expressed in metres, a radius of half a metre will only pick up hyper local clusters. This might be of interest in some cases but, in others, it can result in odd outputs. 

Let us change those parameters to see if we can pick up more general patterns. For example, let us say a cluster needs to, at least, have roughly 1% of all the points in the dataset:


```python
# Obtain the number of points 1% of the total represents
minp = numpy.round(db.shape[0] * 0.01)
minp
```
At the same time, let us expand the maximum radious to say, 500 metres. Then we can re-run the algorithm and plot the output, all in the same cell this time:


```python
# Rerun DBSCAN
cs, lbls = dbscan(db[['x', 'y']], eps=500, min_samples=minp)
# Turn labels into a Series
lbls = pandas.Series(lbls, index=db.index)

# Setup figure and axis
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(9, 9))
# Add base layer with tiles for context
ax.imshow(basemap, extent=basemap_extent, interpolation='bilinear')
# Subset points that are not part of any cluster (noise)
noise = db.loc[lbls==-1, ['x', 'y']]
# Plot noise in grey
ax.scatter(noise['x'], noise['y'], c='grey', s=5, linewidth=0)
# Plot all points that are not noise in red
# NOTE how this is done through some fancy indexing, where
#      we take the index of all points (tw) and substract from
#      it the index of those that are noise
ax.scatter(db.loc[db.index.difference(noise.index), 'x'], \
           db.loc[db.index.difference(noise.index), 'y'], \
          c='red', linewidth=0)
# Remove axes
ax.set_axis_off()
# Display the figure
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

Overall, this chapter has provided an overview of methods to analyze point patterns. From measuring their location, central tendency, and extent, to observing how they cluster or disperse and locating where the clusters are, point pattern analysis has many applications across classical statistical fields as well as in data science. Using the techniques discussed here, you should be able to answer fundamental questions about many point patterns. Further, we will cover *modelling* point patterns, such as describing their properties or future locations, in subsequent chapters.
